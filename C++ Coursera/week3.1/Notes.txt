The code for this assignment is found in 10 files:
Main.cpp, Graph.cpp, PriorityQueue.cpp, ShortestPathAlgorithm.cpp
Edge.h, Graph.h, Helper.h, PriorityQueue.h, QueueElement.h, ShortestPathAlgorithm.h

Running the program it produces a text output with the calculation of the average shortest path 
for two randomly generated graphs of 50 nodes and different densities (20% and 40%).
For each class and each function there is a commented description inside the source files.

A sample output for a single run is the following:

Results:
========
Average Shortest Path Length for 20% density is: 6.34728
Average Shortest Path Length for 40% density is: 4.37255
