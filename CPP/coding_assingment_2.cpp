Define Class and Object. Write a simple program to design a Class to keep the information of three students. For each student, you must get his/her name, rollno and see if s/he is present or absent. The class should contain two functions viz. One for input and one for display.

/******************Answer*********
 *Class is defined as a user defined type that can be used as conveniently similar to the build in data type. In C++ Class forms the basis of the OOP. A class encompasses data and function that operate on the data into single functional entry, instances of which is known as the Object. 
 * Class declaration is syntactically similar to the structure in C, the difference being that while structure only contains a group of data that goes together and which is accessible all over the scope freely, whereas the Class encompasses the data and the methods (or functions) that are used to modify and access the data in the Class. In Class the data are generally hidden from access directly from the functions / methods not the member of that particular class hence preventing or reducing undesirable change in the data.This process is binding the data and the function which operate on it into tight capsule is also known as encapsulation.

/*  Question 
What do you mean by a Constructor and write about its importance? Discuss about the types of constructors. Write a program that illustrates class/object concept, constructor overloading (default and parameterized) and one of the constructor functions should have default argument(s).
*/

/* ANSWER******************************
 C++ does not auto initialize the variables we declare nor does it initialize the data members in the objects if these data are accessed before proper initialization some garbage value will occur.  For the initialization of the data member some member function need to be declared which can handle the various ways the data member is initialized. If we write a explicit member function to initialize the data member these need to be called right after creating objects.
    
C++ provides a better way to handle this situation. when ever an object is created it automatically executes come default function by the same as the class name while it is created. These special type of functions are known as constructor.

These constructor function can be defined by the programmer and if the programmer doesn't define any, an empty method is automatically generated by the C++. 

Constructors can be overloaded same way as any other functions.

when a constructor is defined by the programmer the C++ doesn't generate the default constructor then it has to be explicitly declared.

    Some  of the constructor are:
    
    Default Constructor:
A constructor which takes no arguments is called Default Constructor. 
  for eg.
      
      class counter{
      private:
           int count;
      public:
          counter(){count=0;}              // this is the default constructor
          counter(int i){ count=i;}        // parameterized constructor
      };
      Here, the default constructor has to be called as
        counter c1;
        as counter c1(); generates error as there is no function in the above class that takes no parameters and returns counter type.
        
        
    Parameterized Constructor:
A constructor which handles arguments are passed to the object at initialization is known as parameterized constructor.
in example above it is the counter(int i){ count i=0;}
parameterized constructor can be defined with the default values so then we do not need to  declare default constructor. for example for above case the code snippet will be
    class counter{
      private:
           int count;
      public:
          counter(int i=0){ count=i;}        // parameterized constructor
      };
      
      calling of the default constructor by
        counter c1();  is ok here as here the default value is used to set counter data to 0.
        call by using
        counter c2;    is ok at run time too
    
    
    Copy Constructor;
The special constructor that the C++ automatically generates, which allows the assignment of the one object to another is called copy constructor, since it copies the values form one object to another.
for eg
    class counter{
        private:
            int count;
        public:
            counter(int i=0){ count=i;}        // parameterized constructor
        };
        
    calling of the default constructor by
        counter c1(5);  // initialization of c1 object by parameterized constructor
        counter c2=c1;  // by use of automatic copy constructor
thus generated copy constructor is default copy constructor generated by c++ compiler.
however this default parameter can be overridden when need arise. The parameter to the construction can be of any data type but an object of its own type, However, the class's own object type can be passed as a reference parameter.
for eg;
    class test(){
    private:
        // ................
    public:
        test(){;}               // default constructor
        test( arguments ){....} // parameterized constructor
        test (test &t){.......} // copy constructor user defined

/*What is a this pointer ? Write down its significance. Illustrate an example of using this pointer*/

/************ANSWER****************
 Every object has an access to its own  address through the pointer known as "this" pointer, which is a pointer to the current instance of the object. An object's "this" pointer is not a part of object itself and sizeof( object) operator does not include it in the result. '"this" pointer is passed into the object by the compiler  as an implicit first argument on every non-static member function call to the object. that is data or member not defined by keyword static.
The "this" pointer used to reference the current object's member data and method. Therefore, inside a member function, this may be used to refer to the invoking object. Friend functions do not have a "this" pointer, because friends are not members of a class. Only member functions have a "this" pointer.
The use of "this" pointer is generally not use that much as for much of the coding it use is redundant and is self implied. But when there are object data member's identifier and local member function declare also have data with same identifier, then use of "this" pointer can be used to resolve the conflict as the  following eg illustrate its use.
        class SomeClass {
            private:
                int x;    // member of object
            public:
                void somefunction(int x);
            };

            void SomeClass::SomeClass(int x) {  // new data x defined;  same name as object's data
                  this->x = x;                  //conflict resolved by use of this pointer to object.
            }

//What do you mean friend function ? Write a program to illustrate the friend function in action.

/******************ANSWER************* 
A function that has the right to access all private and protected members of the class and is declared inside the class using keyword "friend" and defined outside the class is known as friend function. Even though the prototypes for friend functions appear in the class definition, friends are not member functions of that class. A function or a entire class of the function can be declared as the friend. Using friend function can enhance performance. The most obvious use of the friend function is the stream << or >> operator overloading. as these Operators being a member of stream object which is defined by the compiler. When we use these as stream operators (rather than binary shift) the first parameter is a stream. Since we do not have access to the stream object (its not ours to modify) these can not be member operators they have to be external to the class. Thus they must either be friends of the class or have access to a public method that will do the streaming.
It is also traditional for these objects to return a reference to a stream object so that chaining stream operations together is possible..
for eg,
    class Y {
        Private:
            int data;                       // private member
            friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Y& o);
                                            // the non-member function operator<< will have access to Y's private members
            friend char* X::foo(int);       // members of other classes can be friends too
            friend X::X(char), X::~X();     // constructors and destructors can be friends
};
                                            // friend declaration does not declare a member function
                                            // this operator<< still needs to be defined, as a non-member

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Y& y)
{
    return out << y.data; // can access private member Y::data
}
   Points to be noted:
    Friendship is not transitive (a friend of your friend is not your friend).
    Friendship is not inherited (your friend's children are not your friends).
    Storage class specifiers are not allowed in friend function declarations. A function that is defined in the friend declaration has external linkage, a function that was previously defined, keeps the linkage it was defined with.
    Access specifiers have no effect on the meaning of friend declarations (they can appear in private: or in public: sections, with no difference).
    A friend class declaration cannot define a new class (friend class X {}; is an error).
    When a local class declares an unqualified function or class as a friend, only functions and classes in the innermost non-class scope are looked up, not the global functions:
